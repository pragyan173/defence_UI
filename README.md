# defence_UI
This project is created to give the user interface to the user so that they can store the 
data and use it further. I belong to the defence background where I see my 
father bringing documents to home and those papers are the most important thing to
store the information and it takes much time to maintain the file, so it is
necessary to store the data and also to protect it from nemesis and any other mean
which will cause the damage. It’s been said that “prevention is better than a cure”
this is a small step taken towards the prevention. My main motto is to store the
information and help to communicate with the needy. There is been so many cases
where we have seen that information are getting leak and sometimes other use these
information for their own good without thinking of the other. These kind of
malpractices can cause destruction on a big level so to reduce these risks and for
faster detection and remediation of threats I have created a project-
The project is Secret Intelligence agency :
Secret Intelligence Agency has always used undercover agents to solve complex cases and dismantle criminal organizations. We are conceptualizing this software as a solution so that Secret Intelligence Agencies and their agents can communicate through this Software for the exchange of evidences in a secure way. For more security purpose we can use encryption technology when agent try to store their data into database. This help to give the user interface so that they communicate with each other efficiently and effectively.
The main advantage of this application web is how to communicate on a platform and store the data safely, even after so many years the data will remain as it is. In this the head of the department will give cases to their appointed agent and agent after solving the case can update case as per the case report, there is also the part of staff where they will handle small work related to this field.
This can help the department in reducing the paper work and also if we use encryption then nobody can access the data of particular case. This gives the safest option to store and retrieve data for long period of time.
          This is only possible by using the latest technology software and hardware that is use
          of Python Programming language and Django as a frame work. The question which 
          comes in the mind that which language is best for the application purpose every   
          programming languages has their own good and bad point but why use this because 
          in it there is less code to type, it is readable and code is maintainable, compatible with  
         major platforms and system, robust standard library, less time to build.
